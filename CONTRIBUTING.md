# Contributing Tips
- Clone the repository to your local
- Thoroughly test your changes before you commit
- To be able to push, you have to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) which is used to validate the code with ansible-lint.
- Also have [ansible-lint](https://ansible-lint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed. **If you are running Ansible 2.9, you can use this to install the lint**: `pip3 install ansible-lint "ansible>=2.9,<2.10"`
- Once installed, you can normally commit and push.
